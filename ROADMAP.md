## Google Sheets and Firebase Integration
Integrating Firebase with Google Sheets can be achieved using Firebase Cloud Functions and the Google Sheets API. 

1. **Set up Firebase:**

   - Install the Firebase CLI and initialize Firebase in project directory.

2. **Set up Google Sheets API:**
   - Enable the Google Sheets API and create credentials for Firebase project in the Google Cloud Console.
   - Download the credentials JSON file and keep it securely in project directory.

3. **Create a Cloud Function:**
   - Set up a Firebase Cloud Function that triggers whenever the milestone data is updated in Firestore or the Realtime Database.
   - Write the function code to retrieve the updated milestone data from Firebase and update the corresponding Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API.

4. **Authorize Access to Google Sheets:**
   - In Cloud Function code, use the credentials JSON file from step 2 to authenticate and authorize access to the Google Sheets API.
   - Obtain an access token to make API requests on behalf of Firebase project.

5. **Update Google Sheets with Milestone Data:**
   - Write the logic in Cloud Function to retrieve the milestone data from Firebase and update the appropriate cells in  Google Sheets using the Google Sheets API.
   - Use libraries like `googleapis` or `axios` to make the API requests.

6. **Deploy the Cloud Function:**
   - Deploy Cloud Function using the Firebase CLI to make it live and functional.
   - Ensure that the Cloud Function is triggered whenever the milestone data is updated in Firebase.

With this setup, whenever there's an update to the milestone data in Firebase, Cloud Function will be triggered automatically. It will then retrieve the updated data and update the corresponding cells in Google Sheets.
