**The year is 4023. The world as we know it is gone.**

Centuries of climate change have ravaged the planet, leaving it a barren wasteland. The few remaining humans live in scattered tribes, struggling to survive.

**In this harsh new world, you are a Z, a warrior chosen by fate to save humanity.**

You must travel across the wasteland, battling the forces of nature and the creatures that have been warped by the climate change. You must find the lost technology that can rebuild the world and restore hope to humanity.

**Your journey will be long and dangerous, but you are not alone.**

You will meet other Zs along the way, who will join you in your fight. You will also have the help of your phone, which will allow you to interact with the world in new and exciting ways.

**The fate of humanity hangs in the balance.**

Will you be the Z who saves the world?
